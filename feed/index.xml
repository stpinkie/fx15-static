<p>Its been about a month and a half since The Friendship Express was first announced to the world and we are thrilled to see great amounts of positive comments from all of you. Thank you all for the kind words!</p>
<p>Here at The Friendship Express, we have been super busy getting things together to make this convention as awesome as it can possibly get. We have just over a month to go until the big day. In the spirit of making hay while the sun shines, we are thrilled to announce that we are in contact with none other than Vincent Tong, the voice behind Flash Sentry, Donut Joe and Prince Bluebood!</p>
<p>But we need your help. Bringing Vincent down all the way easily triples our convention budget, making that far too expensive for us to afford. However, we were given a counteroffer for the next best thing: A one-hour Skype call with Vincent!</p>
<p>Despite that, this interview will still set us back quite a bit. After putting a lot of money on the table to make The Friendship Express work, we are now turning to you. Yes. YOU &#8211; to give us that one hour window to speak to Vincent at The Friendship Express 2015. The stage is set and the event is a go. Now we are trying to make it better with your help. Check out our <a href="http://pozi.be/tfe">Pozible crowdfunding campaign here</a>. For perks are introducing a whole new ticketing tiers (don&#8217;t worry, basic admission is still free!!) as well as some exclusive limited edition merchandise. The campaign will run from now until the end of the month so let&#8217;s get going!</p>
<p>Together we can do it. Have faith and Believe in Magic!</p>
<p>Love,<br />

<p>Hi everypony!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you have heard the news by now that SSTwo Mall will be ceasing operations after Chinese New Year. If not, then I&#8217;m here to say it is true. The neighborhood mall will be closing indefinitely for renovations.</p>
<p>I am also happy to say that The Friendship Express will continue as planned! SSTwo Mall will be closing for operations in April 2015 so we are in the clear. The Malaysian MLP:FiM convention is happening alright and we can&#8217;t wait to see you there!</p>
<p>Oh yes. A few more things to go through in this update: If you have been browsing through, we now have our deadlines in place for Friendship Pro and Harmony 6. Performance Applications (Harmony 6) close on 1 February 2015 while booth applications (except sponsorship and commercial applications) will close on 18 February 2015. A friendly reminder to all: booths and performance slots are subject to approval by us so get them in soon! Remember that these things are also provided on a first-come-first-served basis so while there&#8217;s lots of space for friendship and fun at TFE, we will still need to know how much awesome to expect!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and we will see you soon. Stay awesome and believe in magic!</p>
<p>Love,<br />

<p>It is great to see you! Yes! YOU! You who are reading this right now! Thanks for dropping by our little website. We hope you didn&#8217;t have too much trouble finding your way around!</p>
<p>The Friendship Express is the result of 3 years of dreaming and trying. We tried to get a pony convention running in Malaysia since early 2012. Many proposals and projects were thrown out, stepped on and even torn apart by people we worked with, some of whom we considered dear.</p>
<p>Failures are a part of life. They are building blocks for the road to success. Over the years we met people, dealt with events and saw our fair share of the high tide. Today, hardened by history and with a bucketful of faith and love, we&#8217;re making it happen. For real.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this then we want to invite you to walk with us. What you see at the time of this post is just the beginning. There are more things coming your way over the weeks to come. From tiered ticketing to sponsorship packages to art projects, The Friendship Express is here to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Keep it locked onto this website and you&#8217;ll be seeing loads more awesome coming your way. Don&#8217;t forget to Believe in Magic!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
